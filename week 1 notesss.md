# CIT week 1 
## important things that i learned 

## 1.1: what is info technology?
_Cloud computing is a subset of information technology that utilizes all of the same terminology as it relates to governance, operations, software, hardware, and infrastructure as traditional information technology._
_in this class you will explore:_
* Compute
* Storage
* Networking
* Security, identity, and compliance
* Billing and cost management
* Management and governance

## 1.2 Why Is Information Technology Important?
_The work of most businesses, schools, or organizations would slow to a crawl or stop without functioning Information Technology (IT) systems._
_More and more companies want to implement more intuitive and sophisticated solutions. “IT can provide the edge a company needs to outsmart, outpace and out-deliver competitors,” says Edward Kiledjian, a Chief Information Security Officer and technology blogger._
* Data Overload: Businesses need to process huge amounts of data. This requires large amounts of processing power, sophisticated software and human analytical skills.
* Mobile and Wireless Usages: More employers are offering remote work options that require smartphones, tablets and laptops with wireless hotspots and roaming ability.
* Cloud Services: Many businesses no longer operate their own “server farms” to store massive amounts of data. Many businesses now work with cloud services—third-party hosting platforms that maintain that data.
* Bandwidth for Video: Videoconferencing solutions have become more and more popular, so more network bandwidth is needed to support them sufficiently.

## 1.3 Hardware vs Software
_Hardware includes all the physical aspects of an information technology system. This includes physical components installed inside a computer like the motherboard, central processing unit (CPU), Random Access Memory (RAM), and hard drives._

_Unlike hardware, software is not something you can physically touch or manipulate. Software encompasses all the data, application code and programs stored digitally, like an operating system or a document editor._

## 1.4: The Four Pillars of an IT Framework
_Infrastructure_
Defined broadly as a set of information technology (IT) components that are the foundation of an IT service; typically physical components such as computer and networking hardware and facilities), but also various software and network components.

_development_

_Development is a process of writing and maintaining source code for software applications or frameworks. It involves all phases of the software development life cycle, including_
* Conceptualizing software
* Defining requirements
* Designing how it will work
* Programming it
* Documenting its functionality
* Testing against the requirements
* Bug fixing any issues 

_Security_
* IT security is a set of cybersecurity strategies that prevents unauthorized access to organizational assets such as computers, networks, software, and data. It maintains the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information, blocking the access of hackers.

_Data_
* Data is represented through quantities, characters, or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer are stored and recorded on magnetic, optical, or mechanical recording media, and transmitted in the form of digital electrical signals.

## 1.5 Common Terminology in IT: Introduction
_This information will help you understand concepts in Cloud Computing which was born from traditional IT concepts._

_common terminology in Information Technology, including:_
* Job Roles & Occupations in IT
* Computer Components
  * Motherboard
  * Central Processing Unit (CPU)
  * Random Access Memory (RAM)
  * Hard Drive
* Areas of Information Technology

## 1.6 Terminology: Job Roles & Occupations
_Each role has a specialized focus such as analyists, scientists, architects, programmers and administrators. Many of the roles started in traditional IT focuses then expanded to also include cloud computing. Understanding of cloud is also starting to become its own role or occupation_

## 1.7 Terminology: Computer Components
_Basic hardware components of a modern personal computer, include:_
* Motherboard
* Central Processing Unit (CPU)
* Random Access Memory (RAM)
* Storage Drives
* Expansion Cards
 * Graphic Cards (GPU)
 * Audio Cards
 * Networking Components
* Cooling
* Power Supply
* Case
* Input & Output Devices
* Peripherals

## 1.8 Terminology: Motherboard
_The motherboard is the main circuit board of your computer and is also known as the main board, logic board, or system board. The motherboard is the main component of a computer and is what connects other parts of the computer through integrated circuitry_

_Components that attach to the motherboard either directly or to part of it include:_
* Central Processing Unit (CPU)
* Random Access Memory (RAM)
* Expansion Cards (like a Graphics Card)

## 1.9 Terminology: Firmware / BIOS
_BIOS stands for "Basic Input/Output System." Most people don't need to ever mess with the BIOS on a computer, but it can be helpful to know what it is. The BIOS is a program pre-installed on Windows-based computers that the computer uses to start up. The CPU accesses the BIOS even before the operating system is loaded. The BIOS then checks all your hardware connections and locates all your devices. If everything is OK, the BIOS loads the operating system into the computer's memory and finishes the boot-up process._

## 1.10 Terminology: CPU
_In Cloud Computing, you do need to understand how CPU's work when you configure a computer or server in the cloud. Your cloud service provider will provide you with a series of options for the number of CPU, speed, and type. You must be able to select the correct CPU for what you are doing in the cloud._

_CPU stands for "Central Processing Unit." The CPU is the primary component of a computer that processes instructions. It runs the operating system and applications, constantly receiving input from the user or active software programs. It processes the data and produces output, which may be stored by an application or displayed on a screen._

_ARM Processor_

_The ARM(Advanced RISC Machines) processor is a 32-bit RISC processor, meaning it is built using the RISC (reduced instruction set computer) ISA (instruction set architecture). ARM processors are microprocessors and are widely used in many of the mobile phones sold each year, as many as 98% of mobile phones. They are also used in PDAs (personal digital assistants), digital media and music layers, hand-held gaming systems, calculators, tablets, and even computer hard drives._

## 1.11 Terminology: RAM
_ RAM stands for "Random Access Memory," and is pronounced like the male sheep. RAM is made up of small memory chips that form a memory module. These modules are installed in the RAM slots on the motherboard of your computer. This is true for cloud as well, the difference is, you do not have physical access to the RAM or motherboard._

## 1.12 Terminology: Storage
_Storage is where you keep files for your operating system, applications and documents. There are two types of storage devices used with computers and servers, a primary storage device and a secondary storage device._

_Hard Disk Drive (HDD)_
* A hard disk drive (sometimes abbreviated as hard drive, HD, or HDD) is a non-volatile memory hardware device that permanently stores and retrieves data on a computer.

_Solid State Drive (SSD)_
* Short for solid-state drive (or solid-state disk, although it doesn't use a disk mechanism), an SSD is a storage medium that uses non-volatile memory as a means of holding and accessing data.

## 1.13 Terminology: Expansion Cards / GPU
_Lets start with what is an expansion card which is a a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an expansion slot of a computer motherboard to add additinoal functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus. Expansion cards can be used to obtain or expand on features not offered by the motherboard._

_Expansion cards include but are not limited to:_
* Audio Cards
* Graphics Cards
* Network Cards
* TV Tuners
* USB Cards
* Video Capture

_Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)_
* Short for graphics processing unit, GPU is an electronic circuit used to speed up the creation of both 2D and 3D images. GPUs can either be integrated, meaning they are built into the computer's CPU or motherboard, or they can be dedicated, meaning they are a separate piece of hardware known as a video card. By having a separate processor, the GPU allows the computer's CPU resources to be used for other important tasks.

## 1.14 Terminology: Misc
_There are many other components you need to understand as an IT Professional. Power supplies, cooling, computer case, input/output devices, and peripherials are just a few. These are important to understand if you are managing physical computing equipment, however in cloud computing, the cloud provider has to worry about them._

_Case_
* The computer case encloses and holds most of the components of the system. It provides support and protection for internal elements such as the motherboard, disk drives, and power supplies, and controls and directs the flow of cooling air over internal components.

_Cooling Fan_
* A fan is a hardware device that keeps the overall computer or a computer device cool by circulating air to or from the computer or component. 

_Heat Sink_
* A heat sink is a device that incorporates either a fan or some other means to keep a hot component, such as a processor, cooled down. There are two heat sink types: active and passive.

_Liquid Cooling_
* In a computer, water cooling or liquid cooling is a system used to reduce the temperature of its hardware, specifically the CPU and GPU. Liquid is more efficient than gas at conducting thermal energy, so liquid cooled machines maintain desired operating temperatures better than their air cooled counterparts.

_Power Supply_
* The power supply unit (PSU) converts alternating current (AC) electric power to low-voltage direct current (DC) power for the internal components of the computer. Laptops are capable of running from a built-in battery, normally for a period of hours, or by connecting to a power charger.
