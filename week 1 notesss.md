## important things that i learned 
###### 1.1: what is info technology?
_Cloud computing is a subset of information technology that utilizes all of the same terminology as it relates to governance, operations, software, hardware, and infrastructure as traditional information technology._
_in this class you will explore:_
* Compute
* Storage
* Networking
* Security, identity, and compliance
* Billing and cost management
* Management and governance

###### 1.2 Why Is Information Technology Important?
_The work of most businesses, schools, or organizations would slow to a crawl or stop without functioning Information Technology (IT) systems._
_More and more companies want to implement more intuitive and sophisticated solutions. “IT can provide the edge a company needs to outsmart, outpace and out-deliver competitors,” says Edward Kiledjian, a Chief Information Security Officer and technology blogger._
* Data Overload: Businesses need to process huge amounts of data. This requires large amounts of processing power, sophisticated software and human analytical skills.
* Mobile and Wireless Usages: More employers are offering remote work options that require smartphones, tablets and laptops with wireless hotspots and roaming ability.
* Cloud Services: Many businesses no longer operate their own “server farms” to store massive amounts of data. Many businesses now work with cloud services—third-party hosting platforms that maintain that data.
* Bandwidth for Video: Videoconferencing solutions have become more and more popular, so more network bandwidth is needed to support them sufficiently.

###### 1.3 Hardware vs Software
_Hardware includes all the physical aspects of an information technology system. This includes physical components installed inside a computer like the motherboard, central processing unit (CPU), Random Access Memory (RAM), and hard drives._

_Unlike hardware, software is not something you can physically touch or manipulate. Software encompasses all the data, application code and programs stored digitally, like an operating system or a document editor._
