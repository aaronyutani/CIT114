# 11.01 Well Architected Framework

_The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of decisions you make while building systems on AWS_

_By using the Framework you will learn architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the cloud._

# 11.02 Reliability
_One of the best practices that is identified in the AWS Well-Architected Framework is to plan for failure (or application or workload downtime)._

_One way to do that is to architect your applications and workloads to withstand failure._ 

_There are two important factors that cloud architects consider when designing architectures to withstand failure: reliability and availability._

_What is Reliability?_
* Reliability is the measure of your systems ability to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when itâ€™s expected to. 
* This means the system is available for use and able to operate the workload through its total lifecycle. 
* All apects of the system must be considered including: hardware, firmware, and software. 
* Failure of any one of these impacts the reliabilty of the system.

_Reliability should be considered a statistical tool. No system is perfect and there is always the probability that your system will function as intended for a specified period of time._

# 11.03 Availability
_What is Availability?_
* In computing, the term availability is used to describe the period of time when a service is available, as well as the time required by a system to respond to a request made by a user. 
* Availability (also known as service availability) is a commonly used metric to quantitatively measure reliability. 
* Availability is defined as the percentage of time that a workload is available for use. 
* Available for use means that it performs its agreed function when required.

_What is High Availability?_
* High availability (HA) is a quality of a system or component that assures a high level of operational performance for a given period of time. 
* A system can degrade, but still remain available in a HA system. 
* Therefore downtime and required human intervention are minimized.

# 11.04 AWS Well-Architected Tool
_The AWS Well-Architected Tool (AWS WA Tool) helps you review the state of your workloads and compares them to the latest AWS architectural best practices._ 
* The tool is based on the AWS Well-Architected Framework (Links to an external site.), developed to help cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient application infrastructure. 
* This Framework provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures, has been used in tens of thousands of workload reviews conducted by the AWS solutions architecture team, and provides guidance to help implement designs that scale with application needs over time.
