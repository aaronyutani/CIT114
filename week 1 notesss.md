# CIT week 1 
## important things that i learned 

## 1.1: what is info technology?
_Cloud computing is a subset of information technology that utilizes all of the same terminology as it relates to governance, operations, software, hardware, and infrastructure as traditional information technology._
_in this class you will explore:_
* Compute
* Storage
* Networking
* Security, identity, and compliance
* Billing and cost management
* Management and governance

## 1.2 Why Is Information Technology Important?
_The work of most businesses, schools, or organizations would slow to a crawl or stop without functioning Information Technology (IT) systems._
_More and more companies want to implement more intuitive and sophisticated solutions. “IT can provide the edge a company needs to outsmart, outpace and out-deliver competitors,” says Edward Kiledjian, a Chief Information Security Officer and technology blogger._
* Data Overload: Businesses need to process huge amounts of data. This requires large amounts of processing power, sophisticated software and human analytical skills.
* Mobile and Wireless Usages: More employers are offering remote work options that require smartphones, tablets and laptops with wireless hotspots and roaming ability.
* Cloud Services: Many businesses no longer operate their own “server farms” to store massive amounts of data. Many businesses now work with cloud services—third-party hosting platforms that maintain that data.
* Bandwidth for Video: Videoconferencing solutions have become more and more popular, so more network bandwidth is needed to support them sufficiently.

## 1.3 Hardware vs Software
_Hardware includes all the physical aspects of an information technology system. This includes physical components installed inside a computer like the motherboard, central processing unit (CPU), Random Access Memory (RAM), and hard drives._

_Unlike hardware, software is not something you can physically touch or manipulate. Software encompasses all the data, application code and programs stored digitally, like an operating system or a document editor._

## 1.4: The Four Pillars of an IT Framework
_Infrastructure_
Defined broadly as a set of information technology (IT) components that are the foundation of an IT service; typically physical components such as computer and networking hardware and facilities), but also various software and network components.

_development_

_Development is a process of writing and maintaining source code for software applications or frameworks. It involves all phases of the software development life cycle, including_
* Conceptualizing software
* Defining requirements
* Designing how it will work
* Programming it
* Documenting its functionality
* Testing against the requirements
* Bug fixing any issues 

_Security_
* IT security is a set of cybersecurity strategies that prevents unauthorized access to organizational assets such as computers, networks, software, and data. It maintains the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information, blocking the access of hackers.

_Data_
* Data is represented through quantities, characters, or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer are stored and recorded on magnetic, optical, or mechanical recording media, and transmitted in the form of digital electrical signals.

## 1.5 Common Terminology in IT: Introduction
_This information will help you understand concepts in Cloud Computing which was born from traditional IT concepts._

_common terminology in Information Technology, including:_
* Job Roles & Occupations in IT
* Computer Components
  * Motherboard
  * Central Processing Unit (CPU)
  * Random Access Memory (RAM)
  * Hard Drive
* Areas of Information Technology
