# CIT week 2 
## important things i learned 

## 2.1 A Brief History
_The idea of computing in a "cloud" traces back to the origins of utility computing, a concept that computer scientist John McCarthy publicly proposed in 1961_

## 2.2 buisness drivers 
_The origins and inspirations of many of the characteristics, models, and mechanisms covered throughout subsequent chapters can be traced back to the upcoming business drivers. It is important to note that these influences shaped clouds and the overall cloud computing market from both ends.

###### Capacity Planning

_Capacity planning is the process of determining and fulfilling future demands of an organization's IT resources, products, and services. Within this context, capacity represents the maximum amount of work that an IT resource is capable of delivering in a given period of time. A discrepancy between the capacity of an IT resource and its demand can result in a system becoming either inefficient (over-provisioning) or unable to fulfill user needs (under-provisioning). Capacity planning is focused on minimizing this discrepancy to achieve predictable efficiency and performance._
* Lead Strategy - adding capacity to an IT resource in anticipation of demand
* Lag Strategy - adding capacity when the IT resource reaches its full capacity
* Match Strategy - adding IT resource capacity in small increments, as demand increases

## Cost Reduction

_A direct alignment between IT costs and business performance can be difficult to maintain. The growth of IT environments often corresponds to the assessment of their maximum usage requirements._
* technical personnel required to keep the environment operational
* upgrades and patches that introduce additional testing and deployment cycles
* utility bills and capital expense investments for power and cooling
* security and access control measures that need to be maintained and enforced to protect infrastructure resources
* administrative and accounts staff that may be required to keep track of licenses and support arrangements

## Organizational Agility

_Businesses need the ability to adapt and evolve to successfully face change caused by both internal and external factors. Organizational agility is the measure of an organization's responsiveness to change._
