### 8.01 What is an Operating System?
_A database is a shared collection of related data used to support the activities of a particular organization. A database can be viewed as a repository of data that is defined once and then accessed by various users as shown in Figure 2.1._

_A database has the following properties:_
* It is a representation of some aspect of the real world or a collection of data elements (facts) representing real-world information.
* A database is logical, coherent and internally consistent.
* A database is designed, built and populated with data for a specific purpose.
* Each data item is stored in a field.
* A combination of fields makes up a table. For example, each field in an employee table contains data about an individual employee.

### Database Management System
_A database management system (DBMS) is a collection of programs that enables users to create and maintain databases and control all access to them_

### 10.02 Characteristics and Benefits of a Database
_Managing information means taking care of it so that it works for us and is useful for the tasks we perform._

_By using a DBMS, the information we collect and add to its database is no longer subject to accidental disorganization._ 

_It becomes more accessible and integrated with the rest of our work. Managing information using a database allows us to become strategic users of the data we have._

_We often need to access and re-sort data for various uses. These may include:_
* Creating mailing lists
* Writing management reports
* Generating lists of selected news stories
* Identifying various client needs
